I **am** these things: Husband, dad, follower of Jesus.

I **do** these things: Make games, write code, be a boss to some rad people at [glowmade](https://www.glowmade.com), learn interesting things, write occasionally, play piano occasionally, walk my dog [Frank](http://www.twitter.com/frankwonderpug).

There's an important distinction there. I am not what I do. 

And there are a great many things I don't know. And there are a lot of people who clearly know many things. Naturally, I spotted a gap in the market - nobody blogs about the things they don't know much about at all. 

So this is my attempt to record what I learn as the mood strikes / as I get time. I'm writing it down for my own reference - because I will obviously forget - and perhaps it will be useful to someone else too.
